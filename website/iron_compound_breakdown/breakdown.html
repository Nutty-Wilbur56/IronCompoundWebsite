    <h1>Breakdown of Iron Compound</h1>

    <h2>VPN server</h2>

    <article>
        The Iron Compound VPN server is a custom-built VPN server that is hosted on a router. This VPN configuration hosts its
        operates like any normal VPN, however, the structure doesn't rely on any well known VPN configurations like OpenVPN.
        As will be discussed later on in, Iron Compound can be broken down into...the server itself, an administrative socket,
        an intrusion prevention system, an automated rule engine, an AI scoring engine, a gulag (for blacklisted clients), a testing
        suite, a client violation and session manager, and two separate logging systems; one for generic server acitivity and
        the other for security violations. The server also gives each client their own encrypted tunnel for communications. It's not
        one big encryption tunnel; instead its separate tunnels for each client.
    </article>

    <h3>Encryption of Communication</h3>
    <article>
        When a client initiates a connection to the server, both the server and client have to verify each other's
        identity. The client is who initiates the identity verification, by sending its public to the server. The server compares
        the received client's public key with public key(s) that the server trusts. If the key passes, the client is
        sent to the next level of authentication. If the comparison fails, the server logs the failure and immediately closes
        the connection. Once the trusted public key is in the server's hands, the server generates a private and public key pair
        using RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) key generation. The server sends its public key via its socket connection with the client.
        After the key exchanges, the client proceeds to send an encrypted AES (Asymmetrical encryption standard) key, which
        the server receives using its public key. The server proceeds to decrypt the client's AES key using its private key
        and an SHA-256 algorithm, generating an aes key. The server then generates a token, along with a finger print which is based
        on the hex value of the client's public key.
    </article>

    <h3>Session Lock</h3>
    <article>
        Iron Compound's session lock is a thread safe that ensures that the server handles each connected client equally
        while preventing race conditions. What is a race condition? A race condition occurs when a compiler executes two
        different methods at the same time, but the actions within those methods are called out of order. With this in mind,
        as previously stated, the session lock acts as a safeguard for the server, so that it can interact properly with
        clients that initiate connections.
    </article>

    <h2>Administration Socket: The Caesar</h2>

    <article>
        The administrative socket as a concept is meant to oversee the server as a whole. The administrative socket is still in
        its nascent form, however it is currently capable of enabling the manager of the server to manually handle the server.
        The actions the manager can take are limited as of right now; call upon the violation manager (will be discussed later)
        to report on a potential client's mal-behavior. The administrative socket is also capable of manually disconnecting
        client's from the server if the manager sees that the client is potentially harmful. The final action the
        manager can take is view a list of all the active clients that are connected to the server.
    </article>

    <h2>Intrusion Prevention System: The Legionnaire</h2>
    <article>
        Unlike other VPNs, IronCompound utilizes an integrated Intrusion Prevention System; The Legionnaire,
        to monitor threats against the VPN server. What is an Intrusion Prevention System, you may ask...Intrusion Detection
        Systems are like advanced firewalls, but at the same time different. Intrusion Prevention Systems filter network traffic
        to root out malicious packets and or activity. Unlike regular firewalls that root out just the malicious
        packets,
        An IPS (at least mine is) is capable of barring potentially malicious clients from connecting to a server,
        router, or any other networking device. The Legionnaire is designed to interact constantly with Iron Compound. When
        a client initiates a connection, The Legionnaire examines Iron Compound's IP blacklist (the gulag) to ensure that
        the client is a good actor.
    </article>

    <h3>Session Tracking</h3>
    <article>
        Session tracking ensures that important client-server interaction is logged and stored. This is also where the client's external
        IPs are mapped with their VPN IP address, for security purposes that is. The Session Tracker begins its tracking of each client
        after clients fulfil the authentication with the server. The components that the Session Tracker keeps track of in a
        dictionary is the client's id, tunnel ip, the name of the client's tunnel, the time that the client finished authentication,
        disconnection time, the client's initial IP, bytes sent and received from server, the finger print of the client, the
        socket the client used to connect with, and the list of violations that a client could make. The list of violations starts out at
        zero.
    </article>

    <h3>Violation Manager</h3>
    <article>
        The violation manager enforces the will of The Legionnaire. If a client is found to have triggered a rule, The Legionnaire
        would call upon the violation manager to mark the client down through the session tracker as having violated the specific
        rule. If The Legionnaire calls upon the violation manager and the violation manager find that the specific client has
        crossed the violation threshold of a specific rule, the violation manager will proceed with flagging the client through
        the session tracker.
    </article>

    <h2>Rule Policy Engine: The Senate</h2>
    <article>
        The Senate policy engine, is a mechanism for automating the enforcement of existing security rules. These security
        rules are created manually via the manager of the server. As of right now the current security rules that will be enforced
        whilst the server is running are...Excessive Bandwidth Usage, Throttling Violations, ICMP flooding violations, Syn Flooding
        violations. There is another rule for Automatic Blacklist Threshold. This rule is enforced if the user reaches a total
        of six violations. I also have the code for striking against client inactivity, but I currently have it commented out, so that
        I can figure out how to implement the rule without striking against the client in a way that would send them to the gulag.
    </article>

    <h2>Hybrid AI Scoring Engine: The Praetorian Guard</h2>
    <article>
        The Praetorian Guard is split up into multiple parts. The first two pieces are of the supervised and unsupervised models.
        The supervised model currently models that of a random forest algorithm, while the unsupervised model models that of an
        autoencoder. As of right now the variables that go into the decision-making of both models are how many bytes the client
        both sent and received, how many replay violations, throttle violations, syn flooding violations, and icmp flooding violations
        that have occurred. The duration of the client's session is also utilized. The other piece of the Praetorian Guard is its
        evaluation method that determines whether a client is a potential adversary. The Praetorian Guard determines if a client
        is a potential adversary through a scoring system. The score is calculated through the addition of the autoencoders mse and
        the random forest's classification. If the score reaches a certain level, a flag is set to tell The Legionnaire to flag
        a session for having triggered the hybrid machine learning engine. In the return statement of the evaluate function,
        the Praetorian Guard includes the reasoning and explanation behind why it flagged the session.

    <h2>Iron Compound's Testing Suite</h2>
    <article>
        Nascent in its development, Iron Compound's testing suite is for running unit tests on the actions of the previously
        mentioned components to Iron Compound.

        <h1>Future Development Ideas and Goals</h1>

        <h2>Dynamic Administrative Socket</h2>
        <article>
            The administrative socket is highly capable as of right now. However, I want to give the administrative socket
            more power and capabilities. Similar to its current capability of disconnecting a client from the server, I also intend
            to give the administrative socket/the manager of the server, the capability of adding and removing clients to and from the
            gulag (blacklist). This is to ensure that clients that are innocent and were placed in the gulag by the AI engine, can be
            released by the manager. This is also to ensure that the manager can catch malicious actors who were masking their actions
            from the automated and hybrid rule engines. Speaking of the hybrid machine learning engine, I intend to somehow
            give the administrative socket the power to disconnect the hybrid engine from the server, incase the hybrid engine
            doesn't work in favor of the server.
        </article>

        <h2>Development of a network crawling module and adaptable AI engine</h2>
        <article>
            The idea of a network crawling module would be similar to that of the AI scoring engine.
            The only difference is that the module would be centered around AI powered network crawling bots. This idea
            is a theoretical one, and I haven't put too much research into the idea (both the architecture and legality of the idea).
            The idea would be; The Legionnaire sends out AI bots to external networks, utilizing the router that hosts Iron Compound
            as a gateway to these external networks. These AI bots would contain some sort of ability to communicate back to the
            existing AI scoring engine. These AI bots would be programmed to search for and watch ongoing breaches and attacks in external
            networks. These AI bots would report their findings to the AI engine to give it information on how to adapt its
            capabilities against future attacks.
        </article>

        <h2>Dynamic Hardening of Server</h2>
            <article>
                Dynamically hardening Iron Compound against zeroday attacks and other types of attacks will require the Senate
                to be adaptable and prepared for these types of attacks. That's where the previously mentioned network crawling module
                comes into play. As the network crawlers report back to the adaptable AI engine, the AI engine will engage with
                both the rule policy engine and AI scoring engine by feeding both engines important data from what the network
                crawlers. From this data feed, the scoring engine and rule policy engine will be able to adapt their functionality
                in order to protect the server against these potential future attacks. The automated rule policy engine will eventually
                need an AI helper in order to manipulate its functionality. With dynamic hardening of the server, I do have a potential
                idea of server adaptability that won't require AI. This idea entails having the VPN server change to a different
                listening port, if its current listening port is overwhelmed during an attack.
            </article>

        <h2>Dynamic Training Modules</h2>
        <article>
            As mentioned early, Iron Compound currently holds a nascent training suite. As one of my future goals for Iron Compound
            I aim to create a fully fledged training suite where I can sandbox different ideas and compare them against current
            architecture. With this sandbox testing, I am to improve the dynamic nature of Iron Compound along with making the
            VPN server more efficient and effective at detecting threats and ensuring client privacy.
