            <article>
                VPNs or Virtual Private Networks, serve as encrypted communication tunnels that enable you to browse anonymously or
                connect to remote servers. There are three types of VPN architecture, Network to Network, Client to Client, and Client
                to Network. With these VPN architectures there are multiple types of VPN protocols. Both VPN architecture and
                protocols will be addressed in this site.
                With The first VPN introduced by Microsoft in the 1990s utilized the PPTP (Point-To-Point tunneling)
                protocol, the first VPN protocol. As time passed VPN technology also progressed from being simple encrypted communication
                tunnels to encrypted tunnels with secure ways of ensuring the encryption. Iron Compound is a VPN that
                is a unique VPN, combining traditional VPN

            <h2>Types of VPNs</h2>
            <h3>Network to Network VPNs</h3>

            <article>
                Network to Network VPNs are structured as two separate networks connected by a VPN. This VPN layout has two
                types of configurations. One configuration is where all traffic between the two networks go through the
                VPN. The other configuration for this structure is to subnet a remote network off of an organziation's
                main network
            </article>

            <h4>Site-to-Site VPN</h4>
            <article>
                Site-to-site VPNs are utilized by extensive organizations that hold offices across multiple regions across
                the globe. Organizations utilize this vpn structure in order to safely integrate distant offices
                with their central network. At each distant office, gateway tunnels are established to ensure that data traveling
                from these offices is encrypted.
            </article>

            <h4>Cloud VPNs</h4>
            <article>
                With a Cloud VPN, users connect to the VPN through web interfaces or dedicated applications. This type of
                VPN is tailored for cloud environments and unlike regular VPNs, cloud VPNs enable seamless integration into a
                company's cloud distribution framework.
            </article>

            <h3>Network to Client VPNs</h3>
            <article>
                With a network to client vpn structure, remote clients utilized VPNs to connect to their organization's
                main network. Through this remote connection, the remote client will look like their on the main network.
                This style of VPN, again has two configuration types. The first configuration gives the remote client
                two ip addresses. One is the clients original IP that made the VPN connection, the other is the address the
                client uses within the main network. The other configuration is where the main network of the organization
                takes in all the traffic of a remote client. If any traffic is destined for the internet, the network
                will route the traffic to the internet.
            </article>

            <h4>Remote Access VPNs</h4>
            <article>
                RA VPNs enable off-site users to securely connect to an organization's main data center in order ot utilize
                applications and information. This type of VPN ensures security regardless of client's location through the
                formation of a virtually private connection via a tunnel between an organization's network and the client's device.
                This type of VPN can include secure methods of identity authentication, including multi-factor authentication
                and advanced methods of data encryption.
            </article>

            <h4>SSL VPNs</h4>
            <article>
                SSL VPNs enable remote users to connect to private networks utilizing secure socket layer and transport layer security
                protocols. The conscription of these two protocols ensures encrypted data transmission between a VPN gateway and
                the remote client's device. Unlike other VPNs that rely upon specialized client VPN software, SSL VPNs rely upon
                standard web browsers; enabling the type of VPN to be accessible to all. There are two types of SSL VPNs,
                SSL Portal VPNs and SSL Tunnel VPNs. With a SSL Portal VPN remote users, through their browser, connect to a gateway
                portal page. This type of SSL VPN is very simple and doesn't support complex operations. SSL Tunnel VPNs, on the other
                hand, are far more complex. Remote users can utilize browsers, however the user has to install client-side software or
                browser plug-ins to enable the creation of a VPN tunnel.
            </article>

            <h4>Double VPNs</h4>
            <article>
                Double VPNs operate similar to a regular VPN, however a remote client is channeled through two different
                VPN servers. The first VPN application encrypts a remote user's traffic and then directs it to the first VPN
                server. The first server then applies a second layer of encryption, masking the user's IP address and then
                sends the user to a second VPN server. The second VPN server then decrypts the user's data before sending it
                to the final destination.
            </article>

            <h3>Client to Client VPNs</h3>
            <article>
                With Client to Client VPNs, remote users run a VPN client on their device in order to communicate with a remote
                device through a remote VPN server. This type of VPN requires users to authenticate themselves in order to
                establish connection between devices.
