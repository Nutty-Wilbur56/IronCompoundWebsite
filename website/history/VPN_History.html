        <h2>1970s: Creation of the internet</h2>
        <article>
            Spawned from ARPA (the Pentagon's Advanced Research Facility)
            in the late 1960's early 70s, ARPANET was developed off a network system based on Packet Switching.
            ARPANET soon expanded fairly rapidly to incorporate research and education centers. However, ARPANET was
            restricted
            in its capabilities, since the network ran on Network Control Protocol. This allowed devices to connect
            ARPANET
            only if the devices were on the same network. There was also another model of networking that went into the
            development
            of ARPANET's development, the OSI model.

        <h2>1980s: Development of the TCP/IP model</h2>
        <article>
            Development of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol model in the 1980s began the shift
            towards development
            of inter-networked remote devices. This newly developed model was based off the OSI model, but it
            centralized
            the purpose of each model layer. These layers are the Physical Layer, IP layer, Transport Layer, and
            Application
            Layer. VPNs are applications that primarily work with the IP layer, helping to encrypt remote user communications
            with a central server.

        <h2>1985: Launch of first major online platform; AOL</h2>
        <article>
            Soon after the development of the TCP/IP model, AOL was established as one of the first major online
            platforms.

        <h2>1990s: Development of early VPN protocols</h2>
        <h3>PPTP</h3>
        <article>
            PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) serves the purpose of establishing secure VPN connections over the
            internet.
            PPTP establishes these connections by encapsulating (PPP) frames in IP packets whilst they're traversing the
            internet.
            These connections however are nothing special. The VPN tunnels are created through what's called a Generic
            Routing
            Encapsulation tunnel. The tunnelling operations can be set in two different modes, voluntary and compulsory.
            Voluntary
            tunneling occurs when a client initiates a connection and the network connection is made. Compulsory
            tunneling occurs
            when the server initiates tunneling at the ISP level.

        <h3>L2F</h3>
        <article>
            Developed by Cisco, the Layer 2 Forwarding is utilized to establish secure end point tunnels across public
            infrastructure
            connecting ISP's to enterprise home gateways.
        </article>

        <h3>L2TP</h3>
        <article>
            Unlike other protocols, LT2P (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) establishes connections between clients and VPN
            servers without
            encrypting client/server payloads. With this in mind, LT2P utilizes IPsec to provide encryption. IPSec also
            controls
            the data travelling between VPN endpoints. Going into more detail, once tunnels between endpoints are
            created, the following
            data transfer process ensues. Data that client wants to send is broken up into packets and then IPSec
            encrypts payload
            of the packet(s). LT2P encapsulates encrypted packets into its own packets in order to create tunnel to
            safely transport
            data through the public environment. The packets are then sent over the internet and LT2P un-encapsulates
            the packets at
            the receiving end and IPSec proceeds to decrypt them. The decrypted packets then have their original data
            restored
            enabling access to them on the LAN of the VPN server.

        <h2>VPN protocols of the 2000s - 2020s</h2>
        <h3>OpenVPN</h3>
        <article>
            OpenVPN was developed in 2001 as a reliable and secure VPN protocol. The protocol operates on two styles of
            transport
            protocols, TCP to ensure control over data transmission and UDP for faster connections. This variance
            enables OpenVPN
            to cater to wide ranges of user preferences and use cases. The backbone of security, authentication, and
            encryption within the protocol falls upon the OpenSSL library. OpenVPN can also serve as a VPN software. Any
            user
            will have to download VPN client in order to connect to the vpn server.
        </article>
        <h3>SSL VPN</h3>
        <article>
            Developed as a secure response to the growing need for work from home situations, the SSL VPN protocol
            enables
            users to access an organization's network without needing specialized software. Within the protocol there
            are
            two types of SSL VPNs, SSL portal VPN and SSL tunnel VPN. SSL portal VPNs operate by allowing a user a
            single VPN
            connection after entering credentials to initiate a secure connection. SSL tunnel VPNs, on the other hand,
            enable
            users to access the VPN through a browser that tunnels user into their organization through proprietary
            software
            or networks
        </article>
        <h3>SSTP</h3>
        <article>
            SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol) operates through creating a tunnel between client devices and vpn
            server.
            This protocol was primarily developed by Microsoft to replace PPTP and L2TP in order to secure remote access
            to
            private networks over the internet. How does SSTP work though? SSTP establishes encrypted tunnels between
            client and server,
            however unlike PPTP, SSTP utilizes SSL/TLS and port 443 to manage security nad firewall traversal.
